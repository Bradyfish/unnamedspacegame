Some pseudocode that should find the nearest object to the player and attract the player towards the center of it.
Unfortunately, this was not able to be implemented in the timeframe due to issues with generating circles.
(See Class Planet in sprites.py)

(in Class Player)
(in update())
    # accelerates the player towards the nearest platform
    self.acc = attract()

def attract(self):
	int closestplatcoords
	int closestplatdist = 99999999
	for plat in self.game.platforms:
		if self.pos.distance_to(plat.rect) < closestplatdist:
			closestplatcoords = plat.rect
	# Return vector2d object that points from the player to the nearest object
	return (self.pos - plat.rect) / 100
